    <p class="information">
      Pokémon is a media franchise owned by video game giant Nintendo and
      created by Satoshi Tajiri around 1995. Originally released as a pair of
      interlinkable Game Boy role-playing video games, Pokémon has since become
      the 2nd most successful and lucrative video game-based media franchise in
      the world, behind only Nintendo's Mario series.
